## How to execute the game?

You want to play? I will tell you how.

### Windows Environment

If you want to play the game on Windows...

```sh
Just execute the file ZombieRising.bat
```

if you don't trust executable files, you can clone this repository and add the source code into a new Eclipse project. Don't forget this was programmed using Java 1.7.



### Linux Environment

In case you are using a Linux OS...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jagumiel/Zombie-Rising.git
cd Zombie-Rising
cd ZombieRising-Executables
java -jar Zombie.jar
```

If you don't trust the executable file, you can also use Eclipse and check my source code.

## Miscellaneous

This game was programmed back in 2012 when I began studyng Computers Engineering. It was a project I did with some partners for the subject "Object Oriented Modular Programming". Now the project is unattended.
